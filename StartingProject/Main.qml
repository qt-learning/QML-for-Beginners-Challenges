    /* Your menu ordering application should contain the following:

        - A variety of Controls from the Qt Quick Controls module
          such as Page, Pane, Button, Slider, RadioButton or Dials.
        - An ApplicationWindow that has a suitably appetising background
        - A cuisine-themed font to use across your whole design.
        - A restaurant name that you can put in the ApplicationWindow header.
        - Customise the ApplicationWindow palette to adjust your Controls' colors
        - Organise your menu into visual Pages with titles for Starters, Mains and Desserts,
          listing some menu items, showing a price and a quantity selection.
        - The total cost of the selected items should be shown in the ApplicationWindow footer
        - Consider how your design could be made from re-usable components as QML Files
        - Add a Button for "submitting" the order and show a visual status that the order
          is busy being processed, and then completed. A Timer can be used to simulate this.
        - If using anchors to arrange your design becomes complex, try using
          RowLayout and ColumnLayout from the Qt Quick Layouts module.
