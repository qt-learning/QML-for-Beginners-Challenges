    /* Your solution should contain these key features:

        - A Text element for each of the ContactInfo properties.
        - The name and photo image should be shown all the time.
        - These should be grouped into two categories "Basic Info" and "Details".
        - Create a button using a MouseArea or TapHandler that can be used to
          toggle between showing the two categories of information.
        - Use a larger font size for the name
