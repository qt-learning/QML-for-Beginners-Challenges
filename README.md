# QML for Beginners Coding Challenges

Welcome to the QML for Beginners Coding Challenges repository! This collection of hands-on projects is designed to help you apply and solidify the knowledge gained from introductory QML courses at Qt Academy. Each challenge provides an opportunity to practice fundamental QML skills and concepts in a practical, engaging way.

## Introduction

Learning programming concepts is most effective when theory is combined with practice. These challenges serve as a bridge between learning and application, allowing you to:

- Reinforce your understanding of Qt and QML concepts
- Build confidence in applying what you've learned
- Develop problem-solving skills within the Qt framework
- Create functional applications that demonstrate your capabilities

Each challenge includes:

- A starting project template with necessary resources
- Detailed requirements and guidance
- Optional stretch goals for additional learning
- A solution project demonstrating one possible implementation

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized with a branch for each challenge:

- The **main** branch (this one) contains an overview of all challenges
- Each **challenge branch** contains:
  - A detailed README with challenge requirements
  - A `StartingProject` folder with template code
  - A `SolutionProject` folder with a sample implementation

To try a challenge, simply check out the corresponding branch and follow the instructions in its README.

## Challenges Overview

### Available Challenges

#### [Introduction to QML Challenge](../../tree/Intro-to-QML)

Create a business card application that displays contact information with an interactive layout that toggles between basic and detailed views. This challenge focuses on fundamental QML concepts including anchors, property bindings, and signal handling.

#### [Introduction to Qt Quick Challenge](../../tree/Intro-Qt-Quick)

Design and implement a TV remote control application with various interactive buttons and visual feedback. This challenge explores more advanced Qt Quick elements, image resources, custom fonts, and complex UI interactions.

#### [Introduction to Qt Quick Controls Challenge](../../tree/Intro-Qt-Quick-Controls)

Build a restaurant menu ordering application using Qt Quick Controls to create a responsive, interactive UI. This challenge demonstrates the use of ApplicationWindow, Pages, and various controls while implementing property bindings for dynamic calculations.

### Coming Soon

More challenges will be released in the future to cover the remaining Qt Academy courses in the QML for Beginners Learning Path.

#### Positioners and Layouts Challenge (coming soon)

Learn to effectively arrange UI elements using Qt's powerful positioning and layout systems.

#### Model View Delegate with QML Challenge (coming soon)

Explore data presentation and manipulation using Qt's Model-View-Delegate architecture in QML.

#### QML Best Practice Challenge (coming soon)

Apply best practices and design patterns to create maintainable, efficient QML applications.

#### QML Fluid Elements and Animations Challenge (coming soon)

Explore fluid UI design and animations by using states, transitions, and animations in QML.

#### QML Debugging Basics with Qt Creator Challenge (coming soon)

Learn the core tools and debugging techniques in Qt Creator to efficiently identify and resolve issues in QML applications.

## Getting Started

These challenges are designed to complement the QML for Beginners Learning Path on Qt Academy. For the best learning experience:

1. **Follow the Learning Path**: Enrol to the [QML for Beginners Learning Path](https://www.qt.io/academy/course-catalog#qml-for-beginners) on Qt Academy.

2. **Complete each course**: Work through each course in the learning path to build your QML knowledge step by step.

3. **Take the challenge**: After completing a course, enroll in the corresponding challenge on Qt Academy. Watch the challenge video, review the requirements, and then come to this repository and attempt the corresponding challenge to apply what you've learned.

4. **Switch to the challenge branch** you want to work on:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/qt-learning/QML-for-Beginners-Challenges.git
   git checkout Intro-to-QML
   ```

5. **Read the README.md** in that branch for detailed instructions.

6. **Open the StartingProject** in Qt Creator and begin working on the challenge.

7. **Reference the solution if needed**: If you get stuck, refer to the SolutionProject for guidance, but try to solve the challenge on your own first!

This approach of learning concepts and then immediately applying them through challenges will help cement your understanding and build practical skills.

## Prerequisites

To complete these challenges, you should:

- Have Qt and Qt Creator installed on your system (All challenge templates and solutions in this series have been built and tested using **Qt 6.8.1**)
- Complete the corresponding Qt Academy course for each challenge
- Have basic familiarity with the concepts covered in those courses which you can gain by completing the corresponding course on Qt Academy

## Share Your Work

We encourage you to share your completed challenges with the Qt community! Post your projects in the [Qt Forum's QML for Beginners section](https://forum.qt.io/category/73/qt-courses) to receive feedback, showcase your work, and inspire other beginners.
